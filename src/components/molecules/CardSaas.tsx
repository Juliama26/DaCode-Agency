          Lunar Strategy SaaS Marketing Agency - Rebranding of website
        </h2>
        <p>
          We got a mission from Lunar Strategy to rebrand their website for
          their SaaS marketing agency. Their vision was to make a clean website
          and playing with their Lunar and Space theme, this mean using icon and
          symbols on the website that went with their branding and where they
          wanted to position themselves.
